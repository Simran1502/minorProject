        <h1>Introduction to Linux Operating System<hr size=".1px" color="gray"></h1>
            <p>
                Linux is a widely used open-source operating system kernel first developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It's the foundation of many popular operating systems known as Linux distributions (distros), such as Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, and CentOS, each with its own package management system, software repositories, and user interface.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Overall, Linux is a powerful and versatile operating system that offers a free and open alternative to proprietary systems. Its flexibility, security, and performance make it a popular choice for a wide range of computing tasks.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h3> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Architecture of Linux</h3>
            <p>
                Linux architecture has the following components: 
                <ol type="i">
                <li>
                    <b>Kernel :</b> Kernel is the core of the Linux based operating system. It virtualizes the common hardware resources of the computer to provide each process with its virtual resources. This makes the process seem as if it is the sole process running on the machine. The kernel is also responsible for preventing and mitigating conflicts between different processes.<br><br> Different types of the kernel are: 
                    <ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                        <li>Monolithic Kernel</li>
                        <li>Hybrid kernels</li>
                        <li>Exo kernels</li>
                        <li>Micro kernels</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>System Library :</b> Linux uses system libraries, also known as shared libraries, to implement various functionalities of the operating system. These libraries contain pre-written code that applications can use to perform specific tasks. By using these libraries, developers can save time and effort, as they don’t need to write the same code repeatedly. System libraries act as an interface between applications and the kernel, providing a standardized and efficient way for applications to interact with the underlying system.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Shell :</b> The shell is the user interface of the Linux Operating System. It allows users to interact with the system by entering commands, which the shell interprets and executes. The shell serves as a bridge between the user and the kernel, forwarding the user’s requests to the kernel for processing. It provides a convenient way for users to perform various tasks, such as running programs, managing files, and configuring the system.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Hardware Layer :</b> The hardware layer encompasses all the physical components of the computer, such as RAM (Random Access Memory), HDD (Hard Disk Drive), CPU (Central Processing Unit), and input/output devices. This layer is responsible for interacting with the Linux Operating System and providing the necessary resources for the system and applications to function properly. The Linux kernel and system libraries enable communication and control over these hardware components, ensuring that they work harmoniously together.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>System Utility :</b> System utilities are essential tools and programs provided by the Linux Operating System to manage and configure various aspects of the system. These utilities perform tasks such as installing software, configuring network settings, monitoring system performance, managing users and permissions, and much more. System utilities simplify system administration tasks, making it easier for users to maintain their Linux systems efficiently.
                </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Kernel :</b> At its core, Linux is a kernel, which is the central component of the operating system responsible for managing hardware resources and providing essential services for all other parts of the system.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Open Source :</b> One of the defining features of Linux is its open-source nature. This means that its source code is freely available for anyone to study, modify, and distribute. This has led to a vibrant community of developers contributing to its development and improvement. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Distributions (Distros) :</b> Linux is not typically used in its pure kernel form; instead, it's packaged with additional software and utilities to create complete operating systems known as distributions or distros. Each distro may have its own package management system, default software selection, and configuration tools.

                <p>
                    The shell is the Linux command line interpreter. It provides an interface between the user and the kernel and executes programs called commands. For example, if a user enters ls then the shell executes the ls command. The shell can also execute other programs such as applications, scripts, and user programs (e.g., written in c or the shell programming language).
                    <br><br>
                    Linux has often been criticized for being very terse (it’s rumored that its designers were bad typists). Many commands have short, cryptic names - vowels are a rarity:
                    <br>
                    awk, cat, cp, cd, chmod, grep, find, ls, mv, ps, rm                
                </p>

                    <p>
                        Basic shell commands in Linux are fundamental instructions used within the command line interface (CLI) to perform various tasks and operations on a Linux-based operating system. These commands allow users to interact with the system, manage files and directories, manipulate data, perform administrative tasks, and execute programs or scripts.

                    <h3>3.2. Shell Variables</h3>
                    <p>
                        A shell variable is a character string in a shell that stores some value. It could be an integer, filename, string, or some shell command itself. Basically, it is a pointer to the actual data stored in memory. We have a few rules that have to be followed while writing variables in the script. Overall knowing the shell variable scripting leads us to write strong and good shell scripts.
                        <br><br>

                        <b><i>3.2.1. Rules for variable definition</i></b>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>
                            A variable name could contain any alphabet (a-z, A-Z), any digits (0-9), and an underscore ( _ ). However, a variable name must start with an alphabet or underscore. It can never start with a number. Following are some examples of valid and invalid variable names:
                            <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                                <li>
                                    <b>Valid Variable Names :</b><br>
                                    <div class="block">
                                        ABC <br>

                                    </div>
                                </li>

                                    <b>Invalid variable names :</b> <br>
                                    <div class="block">
                                        2_AN <br>

                            </ul>

                            <b>Note :</b> It must be noted that no other special character except underscore can be used in a variable name because all other special characters have special meanings in Shell Scripting.

                <p>
                    Before we dive into Linux server details, we will first explain what we mean by a Linux server and show how a Linux server differs from a Linux desktop. <br><br>
                    Both Linux desktops and Linux servers use the same Linux kernel,
                    run the same shells, and even have the ability to run the same  programs. The difference comes in which programs they primarily run and how those programs run on the system. <br><br>
                    Linux desktops primarily focus on personal programs that you run from a graphical desktop interface, such as when you browse the Internet or edit a document. The graphical desktop provides an easy interface for users to interact with the operating system and all files and programs. You start programs by selecting them from a menu system or clicking a desktop icon. In the desktop world, everything is interactive.
                    <br> <br>
                    Linux servers primarily operate without any human interaction.There’s no one sitting at a desktop launching applications (and in fact, many servers don’t even have a dedicated monitor and keyboard). The server runs programs that provide shared resources (called services) to multiple users (clients), normally in a network environment. Many services run all the time, even when no clients are actively using them.
                    <br> <br>
                    Linux is widely used as a server operating system due to its stability, security, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. There are some basic internet services that Linux servers are known
                    to do well and that have become standards across the Internet.

                    <h3>4.2. Use of linux as File Server</h3>
                    <p>
                        These days, the sharing of files has become a necessity in any business environment. Allowing multiple employees to create and edit files in a common folder can greatly improve collaboration efforts in any project.
                        <br><br>
                        While sharing files via a web server is common in a wide area network environment, there are easier ways to do that within a local network. There are two basic methods for sharing files in a local network environment:
                        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                            <li>peer-to-peer</li>
                            <li>Client/server</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            In a peer-to-peer network, one workstation enables another workstation to access files stored locally on its hard drive. This method allows collaboration between two employees on a small local network but becomes somewhat difficult if you need to share data between more than two people.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The client-server method of file sharing utilizes a centralized file server for sharing files that multiple clients can access and modify as needed. However, with the centralized file server, an administrator must control who has access to which files and folders, protecting them from unauthorized access.
                        </p>

                    File system is a logical and physical system for organizing, managing and accessing the files and directories on a device's solid-state drive (SSD), hard-disk drive (HDD) or other media. Without a file system, the operating system (OS) would see only large chunks of data without any way to distinguish one file from the next. As data capacities increase, the efficient organization and accessibility of individual files becomes even more important in data storage.

                    <p>
                        A file system mainly consists of 3 layers. From top to bottom:

                            <li>
                                <b>Logical File System :</b> The Logical File System acts as the interface between the user applications and the file system itself. It facilitates essential operations such as opening, reading, and closing files. Essentially, it serves as the user-friendly front-end, ensuring that applications can interact with the file system in a way that aligns with user expectations.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Virtual File System :</b> The Virtual File System (VFS) is a crucial layer that enables the concurrent operation of multiple instances of physical file systems. It provides a standardized interface, allowing different file systems to coexist and operate simultaneously. This layer abstracts the underlying complexities, ensuring compatibility and cohesion between various file system implementations.

                                <b>Physical File System :</b> The Physical File System is responsible for the tangible management and storage of physical memory blocks on the disk. It handles the low-level details of storing and retrieving data, interacting directly with the hardware components. This layer ensures the efficient allocation and utilization of physical storage resources, contributing to the overall performance and reliability of the file system.

                    5.2. Working of file system
                   </h3>
                   <p>
                    A file system stores and organizes data. It can be thought of as a type of index for all the data contained in a storage device. In addition to SSDs and HDDs, file systems are used for optical disks, flash drives and magnetic tape.
                   </p>
                   <br>
                   <p>
                    File systems specify conventions for naming files, including the maximum number of characters in a name, which characters can be used and -- in some systems -- how long the file name extension can be. In many file systems, file names are not case sensitive.
                   </p>
                   <br>
                   <p>
                    Along with a file's content data, a file system maintains metadata about the files along with other information. The metadata might include details such as the file size, creation date or location in the directory.
                   </p>
                   <br>
                   <p>
                    Most file systems organize files in a directory hierarchy, with a file's location described by its path within the directory structure. The directories -- folders in Windows -- are organized into an inverted hierarchical tree structure, with the root directory at the top. Each file is placed in a directory or subdirectory at the desired location within the tree structure.
                   </p>

                    <p>
                        Before files and directories can be defined on a storage medium, one or more partitions must first be created. A partition is a region of storage that the OS manages separately from other partitions, much like managing individual drives. Each partition can be formatted with a different file system to provide greater flexibility.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Separate partitions help to isolate files and operations from each other, which can benefit performance, security and maintenance. For example, a computer's SSD might contain three partitions: one for the OS files, one for the user files and one for the system's recovery files. If the file system on one partition gets corrupted, the data on a different partition should be safe.

                        When you're working with GUI applications or window managers in Linux, you may encounter the term "geometry" in various contexts:
                    </p> <br>
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>
                            <b>Window Geometry :</b> This refers to the size and position of a window on the screen. It includes attributes such as width, height, X and Y coordinates (position), and possibly other properties like minimum and maximum sizes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Display Resolution :</b> Display geometry can also refer to the resolution of a monitor or screen, which is represented by the number of pixels horizontally and vertically. For example, "1920x1080" represents a screen resolution of 1920 pixels wide by 1080 pixels high.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Window Manager Configuration :</b> Many Linux desktop environments and window managers allow users to configure window geometry preferences. This might include settings for window placement, snapping behavior, resizing rules, etc.

                            <b>ext (Extended File System): </b> Implemented in 1992, it is the first file system specifically designed for Linux. It is the first member of the ext family of file systems.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>ext2 :</b> The second ext was developed in 1993. It is a non-journaling file system that is preferred to be used with flash drives and SSDs. It solved the problems of separate timestamp for access, inode modification and data modification. Due to not being journaled, it is slow to load at boot time.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Xiafs: </b> Also developed in 1993, this file system was less powerful and functional than ext2 and is no longer in use anywhere.

                        <li>
                            <b>ext3: </b> The third ext developed in 1999 is a journaling file system. It is reliable and unlike ext2, it prevents long delays at system boot if the file system is in an inconsistent state after an unclean shutdown. Other factors that make it better and different than ext2 are online file system growth and HTree indexing for large directories.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <b>ext4 :</b> The fourth ext developed in 2006, is a journaling file system. It has backward compatibility with ext3 and ext2 and it provides several other features, some of which are persistent pre-allocation, unlimited number of subdirectories, metadata checksumming and large file size. ext4 is the default file system for many Linux distributions and also has compatibility with Windows and Macintosh.

                    <p>
                        In Linux file systems, particularly in those based on the traditional UNIX file system architecture (like ext2, ext3, and ext4), there are three  important data structures: the boot block, superblock and I-Node:
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>

                                    <li>
                                        The boot block is the first sector of a partition or disk and contains the boot loader code necessary for booting the operating system.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        It typically includes instructions on how to load the operating system kernel into memory and start the boot process.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The boot block is critical for the initial bootstrapping of the operating system and is not directly related to file system management.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        In modern Linux systems, the boot block is commonly managed by boot loaders like GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader) or LILO (LInux LOader).

                                    <li>
                                        The superblock is consulted by the file system driver during mount operations to understand the layout and characteristics of the file system.

                                <b>I-Node :</b> An inode (index node) is a data structure that stores metadata about a file or directory. Each file and directory on a file system is represented by an inode. Inodes contain information such as file ownership, permissions, timestamps, file size, and pointers to the actual data blocks on the disk where the file's contents are stored.

                    Process control in Linux refers to the management and manipulation of processes running on the system. A process is an instance of a running program, and Linux provides various tools and mechanisms for controlling and interacting with processes. 
                </p> <br>
                <p>
                    some key aspects of process control in Linux:
                    <br><br>
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>
                            <b>Process Creation: </b> in Linux are created using the `fork()` system call, which creates a new child process that is a copy of the parent process. The `exec()` family of functions can then be used to replace the contents of the child process with a new program image.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Process Termination:</b> Processes can terminate voluntarily by calling the `exit()` system call or involuntarily due to errors or signals. The `kill` command can be used to send signals to processes, allowing them to be terminated gracefully or forcefully.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Process Monitoring:</b> The `ps` command is used to list currently running processes along with their process IDs (PIDs), CPU and memory usage, and other information. The `top` command provides a dynamic view of processes and system resource usage.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Process Prioritization:</b> Linux uses priority levels to schedule processes for execution on the CPU. The `nice` and `renice` commands are used to adjust the priority of processes, allowing users to control the allocation of CPU resources.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Process Synchronization: </b> provides mechanisms such as semaphores, mutexes, and condition variables for synchronizing access to shared resources among multiple processes. These synchronization primitives are typically used in multi-threaded or multi-process applications.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Signals:</b> Signals are software interrupts used to notify processes of events or to request termination. Common signals include `SIGINT` (interrupt from keyboard), `SIGTERM` (termination request), and `SIGKILL` (forceful termination). The `kill` command can be used to send signals to processes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Process States:</b> Processes in Linux can be in various states, including:
                            <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                                <li>
                                    <b>Running:</b> Currently executing on the CPU.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Sleeping:</b> Waiting for an event to occur (e.g., I/O operation completion).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Zombie:</b> Terminated but still has an entry in the process table until its parent retrieves its exit status.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Stopped: </b>Suspended, usually in response to a `SIGSTOP` signal.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                    <p>
                        Processes have various attributes that define their behavior, state, and resource utilization. Understanding these attributes is crucial for managing and monitoring processes effectively. Here are some common process attributes in Linux:
                        <ol type="i">
                            <li>
                                <b>Process ID (PID):</b> A unique identifier assigned to each process when it is created. PIDs are used to reference and manage processes.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Parent Process ID (PPID):</b> The PID of the parent process that created the current process. This attribute helps establish the process hierarchy.
                            </li>

                        Process scheduling refers to the mechanism by which the operating system decides which processes to run on the CPU and for how long. The Linux kernel employs various scheduling algorithms to efficiently manage system resources and ensure responsive and fair execution of processes. Here's an overview of process scheduling in Linux:

                            <li>

                                        Linux supports multiple scheduling classes, each optimized for different types of workloads and system requirements. The main scheduler classes in Linux are:

                                        Each process in Linux is assigned a priority level that determines its scheduling order. Priority levels range from -20 (highest priority) to 19 (lowest priority).

                                        Preemption allows the kernel to interrupt a running process to give CPU time to a higher-priority process. Preemption is essential for real-time and time-critical applications.

                    There are some security measures, by which Linux systems can effectively protect against unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security threats, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of system resources and data.
                    <ol type="i">
                        <li>
                            <h3>
                                Physical Security 
                            </h3>
                            Physical security involves protecting the physical hardware and infrastructure of a system from unauthorized access, theft, and damage. This includes measures such as securing server rooms, using access control mechanisms like locks and biometric scanners, and monitoring physical access through surveillance cameras and alarms.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Controlling System Access</h3>
                            Controlling system access involves managing user accounts, authentication mechanisms, and authorization policies to ensure that only authorized users can access system resources. This includes enforcing strong password policies, using multi-factor authentication (MFA), and restricting remote access through firewalls and VPNs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Restricted Shells</h3>
                            Restricted shells, such as `rbash` (restricted bash) or `rksh` (restricted korn shell), limit the capabilities of users when they log in. These shells restrict access to certain commands, directories, and system resources to prevent users from executing potentially harmful actions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Controlling File Access</h3>
                            File access control involves managing permissions and access rights to files and directories on the system. This includes using file permissions (e.g., chmod), ownership (e.g., chown), and access control lists (ACLs) to restrict access to sensitive files and directories.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>File Access Commands</h3>
                            Common file access commands in Linux include `chmod` (change file permissions), `chown` (change file ownership), and `ls` (list directory contents). These commands are used to view and modify file permissions, ownership, and other attributes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Access Control Lists (ACLs)</h3>
                            ACLs are an extension of traditional file permissions that allow finer-grained control over file access. ACLs define permissions for specific users and groups beyond the owner and group associated with a file.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Setting ACL Entries</h3>
                            ACL entries can be set using the `setfacl` command in Linux. This command allows you to specify user and group permissions, as well as default ACLs for newly created files and directories.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Modifying ACL Entries on a File</h3>
                            ACL entries on a file can be modified using the `setfacl` command with appropriate options to add, modify, or remove specific ACL entries.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Deleting ACL Entries on a File</h3>
                            ACL entries on a file can be deleted using the `setfacl` command with the `-x` option followed by the entry to be deleted.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Restricting FTP</h3>
                            Restricting FTP access involves configuring the FTP server (e.g., vsftpd) to enforce access control policies, limit user permissions, and encrypt data transmission using protocols like FTPS or SFTP.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Securing Super User Access</h3>
                            Securing superuser (root) access involves implementing measures such as password protection, limiting remote root login, using sudo for privilege escalation, and auditing root activities.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Restricting Root Access</h3>
                            Restricting root access involves limiting the use of the root account to perform administrative tasks and encouraging the use of regular user accounts with sudo privileges for routine activities.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Monitoring Super User Access</h3>
                            Monitoring superuser access involves logging and auditing root activities using tools like auditd, syslog, and centralized logging solutions. This helps track changes made by root users and detect unauthorized activities.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>TCP Wrappers</h3>
                            TCP wrappers provide access control and monitoring for network services by filtering incoming connections based on IP addresses, hostnames, and other criteria. Configuration files like `/etc/hosts.allow` and `/etc/hosts.deny` control access to services configured to use TCP wrappers.
                        </li>

                    DHCP is a network protocol used to automatically assign IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateways, DNS servers, and other network configuration parameters to devices on a network.
                    <br><br>
                    It simplifies network administration by dynamically allocating and managing IP addresses without manual intervention and it operates based on a client-server model, where DHCP servers centrally manage IP address allocation and lease management for client devices.
                </p>

                <div class="leasetime" id="section8.1">
                    <h3>8.1. DHCP Leased Time</h3>

                        <li>
                            DHCP leases are temporary assignments of IP addresses to client devices.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The lease time determines how long a client can use the assigned IP address before it expires and needs to be renewed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Lease times are specified in seconds or minutes and can be configured by DHCP administrators based on network requirements.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Shorter lease times allow for more dynamic IP address management and quicker reallocation of addresses, while longer lease times reduce DHCP server overhead and network traffic.
                        </li>

                        <p>
                            DHCP supports three types of IP address allocation :

                                <li>
                                    <b>Static Allocation:</b> IP addresses are manually assigned to specific devices based on their MAC addresses. Static assignments ensure that devices always receive the same IP address.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Dynamic Allocation:</b> IP addresses are assigned dynamically from a pool of available addresses. DHCP servers manage a pool of addresses and assign them to clients as needed.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Automatic Allocation:</b> IP addresses are permanently assigned to devices, but other configuration parameters (e.g., subnet mask, default gateway) are provided dynamically by the DHCP server.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            DHCP deployment planning involves assessing network requirements, addressing schemes, and scalability considerations.

                        <li>
                            DHCP administrators should plan for sufficient DHCP server capacity, fault tolerance, and load balancing to ensure reliable IP address allocation and network availability.
