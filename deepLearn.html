                Deep Learning is a subfield of Machine Learning that involves the use of neural networks to model and solve complex problems. Neural networks are modeled after the structure and function of the human brain and consist of layers of interconnected nodes that process and transform data.
                The key characteristic of Deep Learning is the use of deep neural networks, which have multiple layers of interconnected nodes. These networks can learn complex representations of data by discovering hierarchical patterns and features in the data. Deep Learning algorithms can automatically learn and improve from data without the need for manual feature engineering.
                Deep Learning has achieved significant success in various fields, including image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, and recommendation systems. Some of the popular Deep Learning architectures include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Deep Belief Networks (DBNs).
                Training deep neural networks typically requires a large amount of data and computational resources. However, the availability of cloud computing and the development of specialized hardware, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), has made it easier to train deep neural networks.

                An artificial neural network or ANN uses layers of interconnected nodes called neurons that work together to process and learn from the input data.
                <br>
                In a fully connected Deep neural network, there is an input layer and one or more hidden layers connected one after the other. Each neuron receives input from the previous layer neurons or the input layer. The output of one neuron becomes the input to other neurons in the next layer of the network, and this process continues until the final layer produces the output of the network. The layers of the neural network transform the input data through a series of nonlinear transformations, allowing the network to learn complex representations of the input data.
                <br><br>
                Deep learning can be used for supervised, unsupervised as well as reinforcement machine learning. it uses a variety of ways to process these.

                    <li>
                        Machine Learning : Supervised machine learning is the machine learning technique in which the neural network learns to make predictions or classify data based on the labeled datasets. Here we input both input features along with the target variables. the neural network learns to make predictions based on the cost or error that comes from the difference between the predicted and the actual target, this process is known as backpropagation.  Deep learning algorithms like Convolutional neural networks, Recurrent neural networks are used for many supervised tasks like image classifications and recognization, sentiment analysis, language translations, etc.

                    <li>
                        Unsupervised Machine Learning : Unsupervised machine learning is the machine learning technique in which the neural network learns to discover the patterns or to cluster the dataset based on unlabeled datasets. Here there are no target variables. while the machine has to self-determined the hidden patterns or relationships within the datasets. Deep learning algorithms like autoencoders and generative models are used for unsupervised tasks like clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.

                    <li>
                        Reinforcement  Machine Learning : Reinforcement  Machine Learning is the machine learning technique in which an agent learns to make decisions in an environment to maximize a reward signal. The agent interacts with the environment by taking action and observing the resulting rewards. Deep learning can be used to learn policies, or a set of actions, that maximizes the cumulative reward over time. Deep reinforcement learning algorithms like Deep Q networks and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) are used to reinforce tasks like robotics and game playing etc.

                        Neural Networks are computational models that mimic the complex functions of the human brain. The neural networks consist of interconnected nodes or neurons that process and learn from data, enabling tasks such as pattern recognition and decision making in machine learning, Or we can say that neural network is a method in artificial intelligence that teaches computers to process data in a way that is inspired by the human brain.
                
                        <br><br> It is a type of machine learning process, called deep learning, that uses interconnected nodes or neurons in a layered structure that resembles the human brain. It creates an adaptive system that computers use to learn from their mistakes and improve continuously. Thus, artificial neural networks attempt to solve complicated problems, like summarizing documents or recognizing faces, with greater accuracy.
                <br><br>
                Neural networks can help computers make intelligent decisions with limited human assistance. This is because they can learn and model the relationships between input and output data that are nonlinear and complex.

                        <h3>6.1. Introduction</h3>
                        <p>
                            The term "Artificial Neural Network" is derived from Biological neural networks that develop the structure of a human brain. Similar to the human brain that has neurons interconnected to one another, artificial neural networks also have neurons that are interconnected to one another in various layers of the networks. These neurons are known as nodes or units. These units are arranged in a series of layers that together constitute the whole Artificial Neural Network in a system.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The structures and operations of human neurons serve as the basis for artificial neural networks. It is also known as neural networks or neural nets. The input layer of an artificial neural network is the first layer, and it receives input from external sources and releases it to the hidden layer, which is the second layer. In the hidden layer, each neuron receives input from the previous layer neurons, computes the weighted sum, and sends it to the neurons in the next layer. These connections are weighted means effects of the inputs from the previous layer are optimized more or less by assigning different-different weights to each input and it is adjusted during the training process by optimizing these weights for improved model performance. 
                        </p>

                            Dendrites from Biological Neural Network represent inputs in Artificial Neural Networks, cell nucleus represents Nodes, synapse represents Weights, and Axon represents Output.
                            <br><br>
                            The concept of artificial neural networks comes from biological neurons found in animal brains So they share a lot of similarities in structure and function wise.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>i. Structure :</b> The structure of artificial neural networks is inspired by biological neurons. A biological neuron has a cell body or soma to process the impulses, dendrites to receive them, and an axon that transfers them to other neurons.  The input nodes of artificial neural networks receive input signals, the hidden layer nodes compute these input signals, and the output layer nodes compute the final output by processing the hidden layer’s results using activation functions.
                        </p>

                        <br>
                        <p>
                            <b>ii.. Synapses :</b> Synapses are the links between biological neurons that enable the transmission of impulses from dendrites to the cell body. Synapses are the weights that join the one-layer nodes to the next-layer nodes in artificial neurons. The strength of the links is determined by the weight value. 
                        </p>

                        <br>
                        <p>
                            <b>iii. Learning :</b> In biological neurons, learning happens in the cell body nucleus or soma, which has a nucleus that helps to process the impulses. An action potential is produced and travels through the axons if the impulses are powerful enough to reach the threshold. This becomes possible by synaptic plasticity, which represents the ability of synapses to become stronger or weaker over time in reaction to changes in their activity. In artificial neural networks, backpropagation is a technique used for learning, which adjusts the weights between nodes according to the error or differences between predicted and actual outcomes.

                        <p>
                             <b>iv. Activation :</b> In biological neurons, activation is the firing rate of the neuron which happens when the impulses are strong enough to reach the threshold. In artificial neural networks, A mathematical function known as an activation function maps the input to the output, and executes activations.

                    A layer can have only a dozen units or millions of units as this depends on how the complex neural networks will be required to learn the hidden patterns in the dataset. Commonly, Artificial Neural Network has an input layer, an output layer as well as hidden layers. The input layer receives data from the outside world which the neural network needs to analyze or learn about. Then this data passes through one or multiple hidden layers that transform the input into data that is valuable for the output layer. Finally, the output layer provides an output in the form of a response of the Artificial Neural Networks to input data provided. In the majority of neural networks, units are interconnected from one layer to another. Each of these connections has weights that determine the influence of one unit on another unit. As the data transfers from one unit to another, the neural network learns more and more about the data which eventually results in an output from the output layer.

                    Artificial Neural Network can be best represented as a weighted directed graph, where the artificial neurons form the nodes. The association between the neurons outputs and neuron inputs can be viewed as the directed edges with weights. The Artificial Neural Network receives the input signal from the external source in the form of a pattern and image in the form of a vector. These inputs are then mathematically assigned by the notations x(n) for every n number of inputs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Afterward, each of the input is multiplied by its corresponding weights ( these weights are the details utilized by the artificial neural networks to solve a specific problem ). In general terms, these weights normally represent the strength of the interconnection between neurons inside the artificial neural network. All the weighted inputs are summarized inside the computing unit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the weighted sum is equal to zero, then bias is added to make the output non-zero or something else to scale up to the system's response. Bias has the same input, and weight equals to 1. Here the total of weighted inputs can be in the range of 0 to positive infinity. Here, to keep the response in the limits of the desired value, a certain maximum value is benchmarked, and the total of weighted inputs is passed through the activation function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The activation function refers to the set of transfer functions used to achieve the desired output. There is a different kind of the activation function, but primarily either linear or non-linear sets of functions. Some of the commonly used sets of activation functions are the Binary, linear, and Tan hyperbolic sigmoidal activation functions. Let us take a look at each of them in details:

                <p>
                    1. <b>Binary :</b> In binary activation function, the output is either a one or a 0. Here, to accomplish this, there is a threshold value set up. If the net weighted input of neurons is more than 1, then the final output of the activation function is returned as one or else the output is returned as 0.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. <b>Sigmoidal Hyperbolic :</b> The Sigmoidal Hyperbola function is generally seen as an <b>"S"</b> shaped curve. Here the tan hyperbolic function is used to approximate output from the actual net input. The function is defined as:
                    <br><br>
                    <b>F(x) = (1/1 + exp(-????x))</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Where ???? is considered the Steepness parameter.

                    A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of Deep Learning neural network architecture commonly used in Computer Vision. Computer vision is a field of Artificial Intelligence that enables a computer to understand and interpret the image or visual data.

                <h3>7.2.  How do convolutional neural networks work?</h3>
                <p>
                Convolutional neural networks are distinguished from other neural networks by their superior performance with image, speech, or audio signal inputs. They have three main types of layers, which are :
                </p>

                <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                <li>Convolutional layer</li>
                <li>Pooling layer</li>
                <li>Fully-connected (FC) layer</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                The convolutional layer is the first layer of a convolutional network. While convolutional layers can be followed by additional convolutional layers or pooling layers, the fully-connected layer is the final layer. With each layer, the CNN increases in its complexity, identifying greater portions of the image. Earlier layers focus on simple features, such as colors and edges. As the image data progresses through the layers of the CNN, it starts to recognize larger elements or shapes of the object until it finally identifies the intended object.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h3>i. Convolutional layer</h3>
                <p>
                The convolutional layer is the core building block of a CNN, and it is where the majority of computation occurs. It requires a few components, which are input data, a filter, and a feature map. Let’s assume that the input will be a color image, which is made up of a matrix of pixels in 3D. This means that the input will have three dimensions—a height, width, and depth—which correspond to RGB in an image. We also have a feature detector, also known as a kernel or a filter, which will move across the receptive fields of the image, checking if the feature is present. This process is known as a convolution.
                </p>

                <p>
                The feature detector is a two-dimensional (2-D) array of weights, which represents part of the image. While they can vary in size, the filter size is typically a 3x3 matrix; this also determines the size of the receptive field. The filter is then applied to an area of the image, and a dot product is calculated between the input pixels and the filter. This dot product is then fed into an output array. Afterwards, the filter shifts by a stride, repeating the process until the kernel has swept across the entire image. The final output from the series of dot products from the input and the filter is known as a feature map, activation map, or a convolved feature.
                </p>

                <p>
                Note that the weights in the feature detector remain fixed as it moves across the image, which is also known as parameter sharing. Some parameters, like the weight values, adjust during training through the process of backpropagation and gradient descent. However, there are three hyperparameters which affect the volume size of the output that need to be set before the training of the neural network begins. These include:
                </p>
                <ol type="a">
                <li>
                    The <b>number of filters</b> affects the depth of the output. For example, three distinct filters would yield three different feature maps, creating a depth of three. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Stride</b> is the distance, or number of pixels, that the kernel moves over the input matrix. While stride values of two or greater is rare, a larger stride yields a smaller output.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Zero-padding</b> is usually used when the filters do not fit the input image. This sets all elements that fall outside of the input matrix to zero, producing a larger or equally sized output. There are three types of padding:
                    <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
                        <li>
                            <b>Valid padding : </b>This is also known as no padding. In this case, the last convolution is dropped if dimensions do not align.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Same padding : </b>This padding ensures that the output layer has the same size as the input layer.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Full padding : </b>This type of padding increases the size of the output by adding zeros to the border of the input.

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                </ol>

                <p>After each convolution operation, a CNN applies a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) transformation to the feature map, introducing nonlinearity to the model.
                </p>

                <br>

                <h3>ii. Pooling layer</h3>
                <p>
                Pooling layers, also known as downsampling, conducts dimensionality reduction, reducing the number of parameters in the input. Similar to the convolutional layer, the pooling operation sweeps a filter across the entire input, but the difference is that this filter does not have any weights. Instead, the kernel applies an aggregation function to the values within the receptive field, populating the output array. There are two main types of pooling:
                </p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                <li>
                    <b>Max pooling</b> : As the filter moves across the input, it selects the pixel with the maximum value to send to the output array. As an aside, this approach tends to be used more often compared to average pooling.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Average pooling</b> : As the filter moves across the input, it calculates the average value within the receptive field to send to the output array.
                </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                While a lot of information is lost in the pooling layer, it also has a number of benefits to the CNN. They help to reduce complexity, improve efficiency, and limit risk of overfitting. 
                </p>

                <br>

                <h3>iii. Fully-connected layer</h3>
                <p>
                The name of the full-connected layer aptly describes itself. As mentioned earlier, the pixel values of the input image are not directly connected to the output layer in partially connected layers. However, in the fully-connected layer, each node in the output layer connects directly to a node in the previous layer.
                </p>
                <p>
                This layer performs the task of classification based on the features extracted through the previous layers and their different filters. While convolutional and pooling layers tend to use ReLu functions, FC layers usually leverage a softmax activation function to classify inputs appropriately, producing a probability from 0 to 1.

                <h3>8.1. Introduction to RNN</h3>
                <p>
                    A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a deep learning model that is trained to process and convert a sequential data input into a specific sequential data output. Sequential data is data—such as words, sentences, or time-series data—where sequential components interrelate based on complex semantics and syntax rules. An RNN is a software system that consists of many interconnected components mimicking how humans perform sequential data conversions, such as translating text from one language to another. RNNs are largely being replaced by transformer-based artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLM), which are much more efficient in sequential data processing.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    RNN is a type of Neural Network where the output from the previous step is fed as input to the current step. In traditional neural networks, all the inputs and outputs are independent of each other. Still, in cases when it is required to predict the next word of a sentence, the previous words are required and hence there is a need to remember the previous words. Thus RNN came into existence, which solved this issue with the help of a Hidden Layer. The main and most important feature of RNN is its Hidden state, which remembers some information about a sequence. The state is also referred to as Memory State since it remembers the previous input to the network. It uses the same parameters for each input as it performs the same task on all the inputs or hidden layers to produce the output. This reduces the complexity of parameters, unlike other neural networks.

                <p>
                    RNNs have the same input and output architecture as any other deep neural architecture. However, differences arise in the way information flows from input to output. Unlike Deep neural networks where we have different weight matrices for each Dense network in RNN, the weight across the network remains the same. It calculates state hidden state  Hi for every input Xi . By using the following formulas:
                    <br>
                    h= σ(UX + Wh-1 + B)
                    <br>
                    Y = O(Vh + C)
                    <br>
                    Hence 
                    <br>
                    Y = f (X, h , W, U, V, B, C)
                    <br>
                    Here S is the State matrix which has element si as the state of the network at timestep i
                    The parameters in the network are W, U, V, c, b which are shared across timestep

                    RNNs are made of neurons: data-processing nodes that work together to perform complex tasks. The neurons are organized as input, output, and hidden layers. The input layer receives the information to process, and the output layer provides the result. Data processing, analysis, and prediction take place in the hidden layer.

                        <b>Hidden layer : </b>
                        RNNs work by passing the sequential data that they receive to the hidden layers one step at a time. However, they also have a self-looping or recurrent workflow: the hidden layer can remember and use previous inputs for future predictions in a short-term memory component. It uses the current input and the stored memory to predict the next sequence. 
                        <br>
                        For example, consider the sequence: Apple is red. You want the RNN to predict red when it receives the input sequence Apple is. When the hidden layer processes the word Apple, it stores a copy in its memory. Next, when it sees the word is, it recalls Apple from its memory and understands the full sequence: Apple is for context. It can then predict red for improved accuracy. This makes RNNs useful in speech recognition, machine translation, and other language modeling tasks.

                        <b>Training : </b>Machine learning (ML) engineers train deep neural networks like RNNs by feeding the model with training data and refining its performance. In ML, the neuron's weights are signals to determine how influential the information learned during training is when predicting the output. Each layer in an RNN shares the same weight. 
                        <br>
                        ML engineers adjust weights to improve prediction accuracy. They use a technique called backpropagation through time (BPTT) to calculate model error and adjust its weight accordingly. BPTT rolls back the output to the previous time step and recalculates the error rate. This way, it can identify which hidden state in the sequence is causing a significant error and readjust the weight to reduce the error margin.

                    The Recurrent Neural Network consists of multiple fixed activation function units, one for each time step. Each unit has an internal state which is called the hidden state of the unit. This hidden state signifies the past knowledge that the network currently holds at a given time step. This hidden state is updated at every time step to signify the change in the knowledge of the network about the past. The hidden state is updated using the following recurrence relation:-

                        </b> In this type of neural network, there are multiple inputs and multiple outputs corresponding to a problem. One Example of this Problem will be language translation. In language translation, we provide multiple words from one language as input and predict multiple words from the second language as output.

                    </b><br><br>
                    Like RNNs, feed-forward neural networks are artificial neural networks that pass information from one end to the other end of the architecture. A feed-forward neural network can perform simple classification, regression, or recognition tasks, but it can’t remember the previous input that it has processed. For example, it forgets Apple by the time its neuron processes the word is. The RNN overcomes this memory limitation by including a hidden memory state in the neuron.

                    </b> <br><br>
                    Convolutional neural networks are artificial neural networks that are designed to process spatial data. You can use convolutional neural networks to extract spatial information from videos and images by passing them through a series of convolutional and pooling layers in the neural network. RNNs are designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.

                            An RNN remembers each and every piece of information through time. It is useful in time series prediction only because of the feature to remember previous inputs as well. This is called Long Short Term Memory.
